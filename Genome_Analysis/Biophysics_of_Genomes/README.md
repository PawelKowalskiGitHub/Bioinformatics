Chromatin is a linear polymer that takes on a specific spatial structure depending on the force system in which it is located. The adopted structure is critical to the biological function of the genome because, as is well known, genes close together are either all "on" or all "off" at the same time.

The main task of the project was to generate a globule (polymer) in 3D space, then to conduct energy minimization and molecular dynamics. The structure and process of globule formation in the defined force field were analyzed. In order to understand the influence of the interaction of the nearby chromatin regions (contacts), a comparison of the probabilities of contacts versus genomic distance from both simulationswas was performed. For the second simulation only, graphs of energy, radius of gyration and distance between ends versus time had to be created.
