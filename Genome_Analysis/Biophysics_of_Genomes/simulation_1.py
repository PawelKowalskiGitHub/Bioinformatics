The line below combinescombine the force field with the molecular topology loaded from the PDB file to create a complete mathematical description of the system we want to simulate. We have:
    - Nonbonded interactions beyond the cutoff distance are ignored (nonbondedMethod=CutoffNonPeriodic)
    - 1 nm cutoff for the direct space interactions (nonbondedCutoff=1*nanometer)
    - the length of all bonds that involve a hydrogen atom is not constrained (constraints=None)

CustomExternalForce applies a force to all of the particles in the system, where the potential energy is a mathematical expression of each particleâ€™s (x, y, z) coordinates. 
The loop ensures that the function applies force to all atoms.

Integrator is used for advancing the equations of motion. It specifies a LangevinIntegrator, which performs Langevin dynamics, and assigns it to a variable called integrator. 
It also specifies the values of three parameters to Langevin dynamics: the simulation temperature, the friction coefficient, and the step size.
