## Biophysics of Genomes

The Biophysics of Genomes project concerns structural genome analysis using a simplified genome model, the so-called fractal globule. In order to study a formation process of this type of globules, in the first step, a randomly positioned polymer in 3D space was created, and then molecular simulation was performed in a defined force field.
The project was written in python using the Simtk OpenMM library.
